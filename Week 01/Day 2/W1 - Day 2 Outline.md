# Week 1
## Day 2
This is an **instruction/project split** day.

### Goals
1. Recap HTML5 with the students
2. Reinforce semantics and accessibility
3. Have them practice working on their HTML skills

### Schedule

   HTML
     Recap fundamentals
       The DOM
       Coding in HTML
       File and folder structures
       Elements/tags
       Hierarchy of elements
       Dev tools
       Validators
       Activity: Pair-wise, build out their own 'profile' pages (in just HTML), and validate

     Semantics and Accessibility
       'Meaningful' markup (HTML5 vs older)
       ARIA and HTML
       Activity: Step through accessing their 'profile' using accessibility tools (i.e. screen reader)

     Project time
       Open time to work on the project; divide work evenly between two students at this point (no syncing of Git yet), this is further practice with HTML skills
