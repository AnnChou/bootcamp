# Week 1
## Day 3
This is an **instruction/project split** day.

### Goals
1. Introduce Git
2. Get all students set up with dev environments (in their teams)
3. Have them start working on project through Git

### Schedule
#### 10:00-10:30, Stand-ups
##### Activity: Scrum (15 minutes)
Instructor acts as the facilitator, and moves around the group having each individual answer:

1. What did I accomplish yesterday?
2. What will I do today?
3. What obstacles are impeding my progress?

##### Talk: Today's game-plan
Cover what we'll be doing today.



#### 10:30-11:30, Git
##### Talk: Introducing Git
Introduce the what, why and hows of Git:
- File versioning
- Collaboration management
- Stage + Committing
- Branching + Merging
- Repos, local vs remote
- Command-line vs GUI
- Workflows



#### 11:30-12:30, Lunch



#### 12:30-14:30, Git Time
##### Activity: Students set their own systems up with Git
All students have to set up Git on their own systems, they must use **command-line** Git until the end of the first week. Once everyone has communally set up Git, as a group, step through:
1. Starting a local repo
2. Making changes
3. Committing those changes
4. Undoing those changes
5. Setting up a .gitignore
6. Connecting to a remote
7. Branching + Merging



#### 14:30-15:00, Bio-break



#### 15:00-17:30, Project time
Open time to work on the project. Students must create a common remote repository and start working together through that remote repository. Get further practice and feedback on their HTML/Git skills, specifically creating and dealing with merge conflicts.

##### Activity: Random Commit Checks
On occasion, to ensure students get into the practice of creating branches and committing code appropriately. Check-in with the entire class to see when they last created a commit, and to ensure they are working on their own branches.



#### 17:30-18:00, Debrief
Give the students some time to pose any remaining questions regarding HTML, Git or their project. Make sure to check-in with each group individually to see how they are doing.
