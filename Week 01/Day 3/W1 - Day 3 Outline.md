# Week 1
## Day 3
This is an **instruction/project split** day.

### Goals
1. Introduce Git
2. Get all students set up with dev environments (in their teams)
3. Have them start working on project through Git

### Schedule

Git
  Introduce theory
    File versioning
    Merge management
    Repos, local vs remote
    Command-line vs GUI
    Activity: Students set up git on their system with their preference (GUI or command-line), pick a common GUI otherwise (GitKraken?)

  Use Git
    Starting a local repo
    Making changes
    Committing those changes
    ...

  Git Workflow

Project time
  Open time to work on the project; students should now be working together and making a mess with Git, this is further practice with HTML and Git skills
