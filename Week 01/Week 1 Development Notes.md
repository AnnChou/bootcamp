# Week 1 Notes:
This is a doc for general notes for Week 1.

## Need to cover:
**Working with terminal** - Ruby (will necessitate this) and Git would be a lot easier if students were familiar with and could work within their own terminal windows. Likely best if we could manage to cover this.

**Setting up a server (?)** - Might be useful knowledge, not sure how much of this would be necessary or important.
