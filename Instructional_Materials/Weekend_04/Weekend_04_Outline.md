# Weekend 4
*Please note that this outline may change, evolve or adjust over time.*


## Saturday
This is an **instruction-heavy** day. 

### Goals
1. Recap some fundamentals of programming
2. Recap fundamentals of JavaScript
3. How to work with devtools and JavaScript


### Schedule
#### 10:00-10:30, Stand-ups
##### Talk: Today's game-plan
Cover what we'll be doing today.


#### 10:30-12:30, Programming Fundamentals 
##### Talk: Recapping Fundamentals of Programming
Recap and review the fundamentals of programming (high level overview), such as:
- statements and expressions
- variables, types and operators
- compiling and executing programs
- input and output
- conditionals
- loops
- functions
- scope

While doing the recap talk, have students work with devtools in the browser to try out the different concepts being presented.


#### 12:30-13:30, Lunch



#### 13:30-15:00, JavaScript Fundamentals
##### Activity: Build out their first script
Using developer tools snippets - [support for how to run code snippets](http://devtoolsecrets.com/secret/debugging-running-code-snippets.html) - the students are to build out a little script to 'emphasize' a phrase: The goal being for the phrase to be repeated a number of times, and exclamation marks added. Together, first build out the pseudo-code using the programming fundamentals covered in the first half, then have the students code it themselves.

[Emphasizer.js](Example/emphasizer.js) provides a sample solution with comments.


#### 15:00-15:30, Break

#### 15:30-17:30, Javascript Fundamentals (cont'd)
##### Talk: Recapping Fundamentals of Programming
Recap and review the fundamentals of JavaScript. Materials such as:
- values and types
- objects
- functions and methods
- strict mode

While doing the recap talk, have students work with devtools in the browser to try out the different concepts being presented.


#### 17:30-18:00, Debrief
Give the students some time to pose any remaining questions regarding JavaScript. Make sure to check-in with each student individually to see how they are doing.




## Sunday
This is an **instruction/activity split** day.

### Goals
1. Introduce concept of progressive enhancement.
2. Manipulate HTML pages with JavaScript.
3. Debug some problematic JavaScript.


### Schedule
#### 10:00-10:30, Stand-ups
##### Activity: Scrum (15 minutes)
Instructor acts as the facilitator, and moves around the group having each individual answer:

1. What did I accomplish yesterday?
2. What will I do today?
3. What obstacles are impeding my progress?

##### Talk: Today's game-plan
Cover what we'll be doing today.




#### 10:30-12:30, HTML and JavaScript 
##### Talk: Manipulating the DOM
A presentation covering the fundamentals of progressive enhancement, 
as well as manipulating the DOM using JavaScript. This should include:
- adding DOM elements
- applying classes to new DOM elements
- changing the content of those elements
- working with JavaScript methods and documentation


#### 12:30-13:30, Lunch



#### 13:30-15:00, HTML and JavaScript (continued)
##### Activity: Page Generator
The students are to build out an HTML page using purely JS. The user must be able to set how many elements (between 1-10) can be generated, these elements must have some clear style and structure applied to them, and the program must check for inappropriate requests (i.e. build me 400). Work with the students on some pseudo-code initially, and then give them some time to build it out themselves.

[Page_generator.js](Example/page_generator.js) provides a sample solution with comments, and it is easiest if students continue to work in-browser using an 'about:blank' page.



#### 15:00-15:30, Bio-break



#### 15:30-17:30, Debugging and Improving JS
##### Talk: Debugging
Working through the example file of [debugging.js](Examples/debugging.js) with the students, help them explore the use of development tools to debug a piece of JS code.

##### Activity: Page Generator Refactoring
Students should go back to their page generators, and work on creating functions for potentially repeatable elements, as well as offer the user the ability to re-enter the number of elements they want to generate if need be.

[Page_generator_refactored.js](Example/page_generator_refactored.js) provides a sample solution with comments.


#### 17:30-18:00, Debrief
Give the students some time to pose any remaining questions regarding JavaScript. Make sure to check-in with each student individually to see how they are doing.
