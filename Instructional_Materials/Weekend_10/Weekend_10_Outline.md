# Weekend 10
*Please note that this outline may change, evolve or adjust over time.*

## Saturday
This is an **instruction/activity-split** day.

### Goals
1. Find out what else you can do with arrays
2. Reviewing loops
3. Introducing hashes

### Schedule
#### 10:00-10:30, Stand-up session
##### Activity: Scrum (15 minutes)
Instructor acts as the facilitator, and moves around the group having each individual answer:

1. What did I accomplish last week?
2. What will I do today?
3. What obstacles are impeding my progress?

##### Talk: Today's game-plan
Cover what we'll be doing today.



#### 10:30-11:30, Arrays
##### Talk: Iterating over arrays, some array methods
Working through the example files of [cafearray1.rb](Examples/cafearray1.rb) and [cafearray2.rb](Examples/cafearray2.rb)
with the students, introduce the concepts of iterating through arrays as well as add some array methods to their vocabulary.

#### 11:30-12:00, Array practice
##### Activity: Inventory Array
Working with [cafearray1.rb](Examples/cafearray1.rb) and [cafearray2.rb](Examples/cafearray2.rb) as starting points, have the students set up an inventory for a store in an array. The students can choose what specifically they may want to do with that.

#### 12:00-13:00, Lunch

#### 13:00-14:00, Array Access
##### Talk: Accessing values & Multidimensional Arrays
Working through the example file of [cafearray3.rb](Examples/cafearray3.rb), highlight for students how to set up multi-dimensional arrays, as well as how to access values within those arrays.


#### 14:00-15:00, Array Access Practice
##### Activity: More Complex Orders
Using the guidelines set up in [cafearray3.rb](Examples/cafearray3.rb), work with the students to develop a framework for how they might calculate the total cost of the order if:
 
1. The customer wants more than one item (quantity), e.g., two cups of coffee.
2. The customer wants more than one item, e.g., a donut and a coffee.

The students should then proceed to build out their solutions in code.


#### 15:00 - 15:30, Bio-break

#### 15:30-16:30, More Arrays
##### Talk: Adding quantities and getting multiple items
Working through the example file of [cafearray4.rb](Examples/cafearray4.rb), highlight for students how they can go about getting the user to add quantities and select multiple items.


#### 16:30-18:00, Methods and Refactoring
##### Talk: Refactoring code to add methods
Working through the example file of [cafearrayfinal.rb](Examples/cafearrayfinal.rb), identify for students points in which they could refactor the code by working with more efficient methods. 

*Take a break as needed mid-way through this portion*



## Sunday
This is an **instruction/activity-split** day.

### Goals
1. Introduce hashes
2. Review methods (put different cafe orders into individual methods)
3. Have students create their own scripts for a store

### Schedule
#### 10:00-10:30, Stand-up session
##### Activity: Scrum (15 minutes)
Instructor acts as the facilitator, and moves around the group having each individual answer:

1. What did I accomplish last week?
2. What will I do today?
3. What obstacles are impeding my progress?

##### Talk: Today's game-plan
Cover what we'll be doing today.



#### 10:30-11:30, Hashes
##### Talk: Introduction to hashes
Picking up from our coffee order as an example, work through [hashesintro.rb](Examples/hashesintro.rb) with students to help illustrate the purpose and use of hashes in Ruby.


#### 11:30-12:30, Hash methods
##### Talk: Adding information to hashes, using hash methods
Working through the example file of [cafehash1.rb](Examples/cafehash1.rb) with the students, introduce how we add information to hashes and use hash methods in Ruby.


#### 12:30-13:30, Lunch


#### 13:30-14:30, Hash Practice
##### Activity: Expanding the hash
Students work with [cafehash1.rb](Examples/cafehash1.rb) to develop the ability to add cream and sugar to the coffee order. Reference for a completed script is available in [cafehash2.rb](Examples/cafehash2.rb)

#### 14:30-15:00, Bio-break

#### 15:00-16:00, Expanding interaction
##### Talk: Loops and interaction
Working through the example file of [cafehashfinal.rb](Examples/cafehashfinal.rb) with the students, introduce how we can work with loops to allow customers to order different or multiple coffees.


#### 16:00-18:00, Ruby Practice
##### Activity: Develop your own
To practice all that they have learned about Ruby, the students are to create a version of a store as an exercise. Choice of the type of store is up to the students, or if they are not feeling as confident with their abilities, expanding on the existing in-class scripts is suitable.
