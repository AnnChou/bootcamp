# Weekend 11
*Please note that this outline may change, evolve or adjust over time.*

## Saturday
This is an **instruction-heavy** day.

### Goals
1. Basic overview of classes
2. Introduce validations with example
3. Give students time to review challenging concepts

### Schedule
#### 10:00-10:30, Stand-up session
##### Talk: Today's game-plan
Cover what we'll be doing today.



#### 10:30-12:30, Classes
##### Talk: Basics of Classes
Working through the example files of [ruby_classes-1.rb](Examples/ruby_classes-1.rb), [ruby_classes-2.rb](Examples/ruby_classes-2.rb), and [ruby_classes-3.rb](Examples/ruby_classes-3.rb) with the students, introduce the concepts building a class, and explain how classes work.


##### Talk: What can Classes do?
Working through the example files of [ruby_classes-4.rb](Examples/ruby_classes-4.rb) and [ruby_classes-5.rb](Examples/ruby_classes-5.rb) with the students, introduce how by using methods we can initialize variables to calculate a price for our coffees.

#### 12:30-13:30, Lunch

#### 13:30-15:00, Validations
##### Talk: Adding validations
Working through the example file of [ruby_classes_final.rb](Examples/ruby_classes_final.rb) step students through adding in validations to their class.

#### 15:00 - 15:30, Bio-break

#### 15:30-17:00, Ruby Wrap-up
##### Activity: Final practice + questions
Students can explore adding further validations, writing additional classes, or asking lingering Ruby questions before we move onto adding Rails as another layer.


#### 17:00-18:00, Rails Setup
##### Activity: Rails Environment Setup
Work with students to set up their rails environments to ensure that we can get started on Sunday with no hold-ups or hick-ups setup wise. Having them download and run [Vet_app_pt_1](Examples/vet_app_pt_1) may be worthwhile for testing (time permitting).




## Sunday
This is an **instruction/activity-split** day.

### Goals
1. Introduce hashes
2. Review methods (put different cafe orders into individual methods)
3. Have students create their own scripts for a store

### Schedule
#### 10:00-10:30, Stand-up session
##### Activity: Scrum (15 minutes)
Instructor acts as the facilitator, and moves around the group having each individual answer:

1. What did I accomplish last week?
2. What will I do today?
3. What obstacles are impeding my progress?

##### Talk: Today's game-plan
Cover what we'll be doing today.



#### 10:30-11:30, Hashes
##### Talk: Introduction to hashes
Picking up from our coffee order as an example, work through [hashesintro.rb](Examples/hashesintro.rb) with students to help illustrate the purpose and use of hashes in Ruby.


#### 11:30-12:30, Hash methods
##### Talk: Adding information to hashes, using hash methods
Working through the example file of [cafehash1.rb](Examples/cafehash1.rb) with the students, introduce how we add information to hashes and use hash methods in Ruby.


#### 12:30-13:30, Lunch


#### 13:30-14:30, Hash Practice
##### Activity: Expanding the hash
Students work with [cafehash1.rb](Examples/cafehash1.rb) to develop the ability to add cream and sugar to the coffee order. Reference for a completed script is available in [cafehash2.rb](Examples/cafehash2.rb)

#### 14:30-15:00, Bio-break

#### 15:00-16:00, Expanding interaction
##### Talk: Loops and interaction
Working through the example file of [cafehashfinal.rb](Examples/cafehashfinal.rb) with the students, introduce how we can work with loops to allow customers to order different or multiple coffees.


#### 16:00-18:00, Ruby Practice
##### Activity: Develop your own
To practice all that they have learned about Ruby, the students are to create a version of a store as an exercise. Choice of the type of store is up to the students, or if they are not feeling as confident with their abilities, expanding on the existing in-class scripts is suitable.
