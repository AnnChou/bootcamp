# Weekend 11
*Please note that this outline may change, evolve or adjust over time.*

## Saturday
This is an **instruction-heavy** day.

### Goals
1. Basic overview of classes
2. Introduce validations with example
3. Give students time to review challenging concepts

### Schedule
#### 10:00-10:30, Talk: Today's game-plan
Cover what we'll be doing today.



#### 10:30-12:30, Classes
##### Talk: Basics of Classes
Working through the example files of [ruby_classes-1.rb](Examples/ruby_classes-1.rb), [ruby_classes-2.rb](Examples/ruby_classes-2.rb), and [ruby_classes-3.rb](Examples/ruby_classes-3.rb) with the students, introduce the concepts building a class, and explain how classes work.


##### Talk: What can Classes do?
Working through the example files of [ruby_classes-4.rb](Examples/ruby_classes-4.rb) and [ruby_classes-5.rb](Examples/ruby_classes-5.rb) with the students, introduce how by using methods we can initialize variables to calculate a price for our coffees.

#### 12:30-13:30, Lunch

#### 13:30-15:00, Talk: Adding validations
Working through the example file of [ruby_classes_final.rb](Examples/ruby_classes_final.rb) step students through adding in validations to their class.

#### 15:00 - 15:30, Break

#### 15:30-17:00, Activity: Ruby wrap-up + questions
Students can explore adding further validations, writing additional classes, or asking lingering Ruby questions before we move onto adding Rails as another layer.


#### 17:00-18:00, Activity: Rails Environment Setup
Work with students to set up their rails environments to ensure that we can get started on Sunday with no hold-ups or hick-ups setup wise. Having them download and run [Vet_app-1](Examples/vet_app-1) may be worthwhile for testing (time permitting).




## Sunday
This is an **instruction-heavy** day.

### Goals
1. Have students download and run Rails app (vet_app_1)
2. MVC framework -- what that means
3. Routing conventions (CRUD)

### Schedule
#### 10:00-10:30, Talk: Today's game-plan
Cover what we'll be doing today.



#### 10:30-11:30, Talk: Getting an App running
Students should download [vet_app-1](Examples/vet_app-1) and work through the instructions [on getting the app up and running](Instructions/Getting_Rails_apps_running.md) with you leading them through it.


#### 11:30-12:30, Talk: Model/View/Controller
Working through the file structure of [vet_app-1](Examples/vet_app-1) with the students, use [our overview of MVC](Instructions/An_overview_of_MVC.md) to help illustrate to students the Model/View/Controller convention.


#### 12:30-13:30, Lunch


#### 13:30-14:30, Talk: Routes and CRUD
Continuing to work through the file structure of [vet_app-1](Examples/vet_app-1) with the students, use [our overview of CRUD](Instructions/An_overview_of_CRUD.md) to help illustrate to students the Model/View/Controller convention.


#### 14:30-15:00, Break

#### 15:00-16:00, Activity: Test out the app
Now having a better understanding of the structure of our [vet_app-1](Examples/vet_app-1), give the students time to explore using the app and getting an understanding of how MVC/CRUD operates. Ensure they are performing actions in the browser window, and then looking at which code may be running that particular functionality.

#### 16:00-17:30, Talk: HTML and CSS in Rails
Step students through how HTML and CSS work in Rails, using [our explanation of assets in Rails](Instructions/HTML_and_CSS_assets_in_Rails.md). Ensure that they have a clear understanding of the relationship between Embedded Ruby (ERB) and HTML. 

#### 17:30-18:00, Debrief and Resources
Give the students some time to pose any remaining questions regarding Rails. Also introduce the [rails resources](../Resources/Rails_Resources.md) to students in case they need some additional support.
