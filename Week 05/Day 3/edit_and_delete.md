#####Edit and delete

1) Add edit/update functionality. You can render the same form in your edit.html.erb file. Don't forget to add both methods to your controller.
2) Add an edit button to the show page for the dish. It should use the 'edit_dish_path' href.

NB - We haven't built delete yet, so we will walk through that one in a bit more detail during our next session. Right now, just focus on the edit/update. If you have some time, see if your colleagues need help (or maybe add some CSS...everything looks pretty terrible right now!)
