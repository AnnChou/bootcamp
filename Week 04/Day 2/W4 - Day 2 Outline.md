## Day 2
This is an **[lecture-heavy]** day.

### Goals
1. Create a 'Guess the Number' game that is run through the command line
2. Introduce 'while' and 'do' loops
3. Introduce arrays and methods
4. Introduce refactoring code
5. Review if/else/elsif

### Schedule
#### 10:00-10:30, Stand-up session

#### 10:30-11:30,
##### Activity: Write guess the number game (show students how to get random number, then let them start it on their own), think about requirements (what if someone guesses too high or low?)

#### 11:30-12:30,

#### 14:30-15:00, Bio-break

#### 15:00-16:00,
##### Talk: Adding previous guesses to an array, each/do loop
File: guessthenumber5.rb

#### 16:00-17:30,
